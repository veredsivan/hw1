1. we have copied the part that checks if the data that the user put in is valid, between all of the .c files. that is very unnecessary.
we could have make it better if we would have made a "global function" that checks if the data is valid and call the function in each of the .c codes.
2.By definition - A continuous uniform distribution is a continuous distribution in which all segments of the same length, located in its support, have equal probability.
so, allegedly,There is no preference for one number to be randomly selected more than the other.
to ensure it is true, we randomly selected (using the random function) 5000 numbers.
than, we created histogram using these random numbers.
and the results are:
0-9	490
10-19	512
20-29	481
30-39	505
40-49	512
50-59	506
60-69	473
70-79	514
80-89	524
90-100	483
to conclude, according to the histogram we can confirm thet the grads are continuous uniform distribution.
